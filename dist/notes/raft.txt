different levels of debugging output using flags
add 'GOTRACEBACK=2 go test' to add traceback
time.Millisecond
use race checker and fix those first
timer thread (multiple?)
one thread needs to attack as leader (send out heartbeats)
too many threads - too complicated 
not enough threads - too much blocking to meet deadlines
probably need a thread that solicits votes for the candidate phase
