power reduction techniques
  reducing capacitance
    requires changes to physical layout and technology
  reducing voltage
    negative effect on frequency
    opportunistically power gating (wakeup time)
    dynamic voltage and frequency scaling
      trade performance to reduce power usage
  reducing frequency
    negative effect on CPU time
    clock gating in unused resources
  points to note
    utilization directly effects dynamic power
    lowering power does not mean lowering energy

dependability
  system reliability
    mean time to failure (MTTF)
    mean time to repair (MTTR)
    system availability
      MTFF / (MTTF + MTTR)

instruction set architecture
  well-defined interfacing contract between hardware and software
  defines
    the functional operations of units
    how to use each function unit
  does not define
    how functional units are implemented
    execution time of operations
    energy consumption of operations
  two approaches
    complex instruction set commputing (CISC)
      could be better for a specific domain
      CPU time may be increased
      hard code generation
    reduced instruction set computing (RISC)
      better if memory is a bottleneck
      good for general purpose
      CPU time may be decreased
      easy code generation
