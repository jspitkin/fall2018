Pipeline Hazards
  Data Hazards
    producer/consumer relationship
    read after write hazard (RAW)
    write after read hazard (WAR)
      write must wait for earlier read
      prevents some instruction reordering
    write after write hazard (WAW)
      old writes must not overwrite the younger write

Multicycle Instructions
  not all of the ALU operations complete in one cycle
  typically, FP (floating point) operations need more time
  cycle time will always be the worst case of your critical path
    a good reason to break up more complicated instructions
